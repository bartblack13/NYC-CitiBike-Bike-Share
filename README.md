# NYC-CitiBike-Bike-Share
Tableau and Pandas

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The Purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with Tableau, a data vizualization software. learn how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, you'll create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

# 1. Create a DataFrame for the 201908-citibike-tripdata data.
# 2. Check the datatypes of your columns. 
# 3. Convert the 'tripduration' column to datetime datatype.
# 4. Check the datatypes of your columns.
# 5. Export the Dataframe as a new CSV file without the index.

The updated CSV data file was then loaded into Tableau and the following vizualizations were created, which were then used to create dashboards and a story:
* Checkout times for all users
* Checkout times by Gender
* Trips by Weekday
* Trips by Gender (weekday per hour)
* Trips by Gender and User type (by weekday usage)
* August Peak hours
* Start and End location

The graphs above included multi plot line graphs, heat maps, horizontal bar graph, and maps with pop-up info and markers.


## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
